## Welcome

As soon as your dev container is finished installing, it automatically executes `wails dev` for you. This will boot up wails for the first time, initializing the Vue frontend as well as building the Go backend.

If you see output similar to the following:

```cmd
Watching (sub)/directory: /app

To develop in the browser and call your bound Go methods from Javascript, navigate to: http://localhost:34115
```

This indicates that the startup process has finished.  
You can CTRL/CMD + click the link in the terminal to visit the Wails frontend in your browser!  
You can also click [here](http://localhost:34115)
