# Task 7: List Rendering

Another directive one should know when using Vue is the `v-for` directive. It can be used to render a list of items based on an array.

[Go to Task 7](Task7.vue)

###  TODO 7.1: use the v-for directive to render all items from the list
Add the `v-for` directive to the `<li>` to iterate all the items from the `items` array.

> ‚ùó **Important:** The `v-for` directive requires a special syntax `item in items` where `items` is the source array and `item` is the currently iterated element.
