# Task 3: Computed Property

Alright, awesome! Now you know about reactivity.

Next we will look at the 'computed' property. It's a property that updates automatically when a dependency changes.
That is different to methods as they are called when something happens as in event handling for example.
Computed properties are written like methods but don't accept input arguments. They depend on other properties and are used to output something that depends on something else.

Much text but very simple - trust.

### TODO 3.1: transform this variable into a computed property
Use `computed()` to compute changes on `number` so that every time `number` changes, the `squared` variable is automatically updated.
