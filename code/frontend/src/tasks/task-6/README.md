# Task 6: Element References

In Vue we can reference HTML elements by using a `ref` attribute.

[Go to Task 6](Task6.vue)

### TODO 6.1: add the 'ref' attribute and pass our variable to it, so Vue knows where to store the reference
Add the `ref` attribute to the `<p>` and pass the variable `tagRef` to it.

Thats already it! The text should now change.
